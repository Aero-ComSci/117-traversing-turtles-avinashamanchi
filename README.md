# Write a description of what the program does, who is it for?

## What does it have

- **Multiple Turtle Shapes**: Uses a variety of turtle shapes.
- **Colorful Display**: Each turtle is assigned a unique color.
- **Spiraling Movement**: Turtles move forward with increasing distances and changing directions.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a series of turtles each with a distinct shape and color.
2. **Movement Logic**: Each turtle starts at the same position and moves forward with each subsequent turtle traveling a longer distance.
3. **Direction Change**: The direction of movement changes incrementally by 30 degrees for each turtle.

## Who Can Use These Concepts


1. **Educators**:  
   - **Teachers and Instructors**: Useful for creating interactive lessons that make programming more engaging and relatable for students of all ages.

2. **Game Developers**:  
   - **Game Designers**: Helps understand basic game mechanics such as character movement and animation.

3. **Data Visualization Specialists**:  
   - **Analysts and Scientists**: Can use similar graphical techniques to visualize data, making complex information more accessible and understandable.

4. **Robotics Programmers**:  
   - **Robotics Engineers**: Concepts of movement and control can be applied to programming robots which allows visualization of robotic actions.

5. **UI/UX Designers**:  
   - **Interface Designers**: Understanding graphics and movement can inform the design of user interfaces and enhance user interactions in applications.

6. **Software Developers**:  
   - **Programmers in general**: Developers creating prototypes or simple applications can leverage these concepts for quick visual feedback on their ideas.

## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
- how does using classes affect the code?
- in a real world scenario would coding the code without classes or functions be slower and less efficent or faster and more efficent?
```
#### Description Of The App according to User Story
```
- This app can be used for entertaimment because of the ability for it to draw shapes and print any type of images with color. This app can target younger kids because
of the easy ability to draw and print easy to see shapes. 
```
# Include a video of the result of the code at speed 0 or Fast. Be sure to make it available for me to see.
